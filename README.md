## 🌐 What is Rentmint?

Rentmint is a decentralized rental platform where users can **lend or borrow real-world assets** with the security and automation of blockchain. Using **smart contracts**, **digital escrows**, and a **verified reputation system**, Rentmint makes item-sharing seamless, safe, and financially rewarding for both sides of the transaction.

## 🔐 Blockchain at the Core

Rentmint leverages blockchain to ensure every aspect of the rental experience is secure, transparent, and tamper-proof:

- **Smart Contracts:** Rental agreements are powered by programmable contracts that automatically enforce terms, timelines, and penalties.
- **Escrow Payments:** Funds are securely held in smart contract escrow and only released upon successful item return.
- **Immutable Records:** Every transaction, rating, and rental history is permanently recorded on-chain for full transparency.
- **Decentralized Identity (DID):** Users are verified through blockchain-based credentials to minimize fraud and impersonation.

## 🔁 How It Works

1. **List an Item**  
   Users list items by uploading photos, setting availability, pricing, deposit requirements, and rental terms.

2. **Browse & Request**  
   Renters search by category, location, or keyword and request items from lenders, viewing their trust score and reviews.

3. **Smart Contract Initiation**  
   Once a request is accepted, a smart contract is deployed to lock funds, define terms, and track the transaction.

4. **Rental Period**  
   The item is exchanged directly or via a designated drop-off method. The rental period begins automatically.

5. **Return & Payout**  
   After return, the lender confirms the condition. Funds are released automatically, and both parties leave reviews.
